## Features

### Features required by this course

#### Week 1

- [X] Used the (boilerplate) of the [repository of this course](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/web-app-from-scratch-1819) as a base for this repository.
- [X] A good README document.
- [X] [Load data from an API asynchronous](./client/src/ts/utils/Fetcher.ts).
- [X] Render a [list of data](./client/src/ts/components/Generic/DataList.ts) from an API üêí.
- [X] Created multiple issues in the repository of [Chelsea Doeleman](https://github.com/chelseadoeleman/web-app-from-scratch-18-19) and generally helped a lot of people during this course.

#### Week 2

- [X] Create an actor diagram.
- [X] Create an interaction diagram.
- [X] Refactor code, just take a gander at the amount of [commits](https://github.com/Maikxx/web-app-from-scratch-18-19/commits/master) I made with the prefix `refactor`.
- [X] [Routing](./client/src/ts/App.ts) between pages.
- [X] Implement or build a template engine (take a look at the next section).

#### Week 3

- [X] Manipulate data from the API, [transformer](./client/src/ts/utils/Transformer.ts), [filter](./client/src/ts/utils/Filter.ts), [sorter](./client/src/ts/utils/Sorter.ts), [data-translations](./client/src/ts/translations/translatedTypes.ts).
- [X] [Loading states](./client/src/ts/utils/Engine.ts#72).
- [X] Code splitting was setup from the start.

### Features beyond the scope of this course

- [X] [A custom shadow-DOM / templating engine](./client/src/ts/utils/Engine.ts).
- [X] Ability to search in the API.
- [X] A React like development experience. üï∂Ô∏è
- [X] [Filter attributes and properties passed to the engine based on existence](./client/src/ts/utils/Engine.ts#62).
- [X] Fully written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
- [X] [Pagination](./client/src/ts/utils/InfiniteScroll.ts).
- [X] Set up using a [build tool](https://parceljs.org).
- [X] Data persistence on detail pages on revisit. (Data persistence on the paginated [master view](./client/src/ts/views/CharacterMasterView.ts) is another beast that is way more difficult, hence not included yet.)

## Technologies used

* [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer).
* [Babel polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-polyfill).
* [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io).
* [Concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently).
* [Navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo) - A router on which I based my initial [Router](./client/src/ts/utils/Router.ts), which I now no longer use, but just keep for when I might want to continue with this.
* [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org).
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
* [Wait-on](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-on).
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

## Patterns

* The [constructor pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#constructorpatternjavascript) can be found throughout the application to instantiate from a JavaScript class.
* The [module pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript) can be found throughout the application to structure the TypeScript code and to prevent leakage of globals.
* The [private class data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_class_data_pattern) is used across the application to prevent instances of classes from accessing these properties and methods.
* The [composite pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#compositepatternjquery) is used to extends the base [Component](./client/src/ts/utils/Component.ts) class in the [Engine](./client/src/ts/utils/Engine.ts) I wrote.

## Changelog

For a changelog, please refer to [this file](./docs/CHANGELOG.md).

## Data sources

* [APIOfFireAndIce](https://anapioficeandfire.com/)
    This is a Game of Thrones API providing a lot of information about Game of Thrones characters, books, houses and more.

    This API does not require authentication, but has got a few limits:
    * Rate limit of 20000 requests made per day, per IP-address.
    * 50 requests per page maximum.
    * Is not zero-based.
